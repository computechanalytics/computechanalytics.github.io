<p>Recent advances in personal computer hardware and software have pushed the graphic capacity of these easier to use and, more importantly, cheaper computers to a level approximating the current standard of high end workstations. The interactivity and graphic complexity of a modern PC is rapidly approaching the current standard on Silicon Graphics (although with respect to texture mapping, the SGI is still ahead of the PCs). The modern medical student laboring under increasingly higher demands with respect to versatility, not only in basic science and traditional medical knowledge, is also faced with the requirement to learn and understand modern scientific visualization and analytical instruments. Furthermore, basic knowledge of information technology and computer literacy is expected of the next generation medical professionals. These demands forces medical schools to increasingly invest in computers and information technology for educational purposes. Due to common class sizes, these computers are most commonly Windows PCs or Apple Macintoshes. For distance education, telematics or studies at home, personal computer versions of the workstation graphics are a necessity. 3D-Brain 2.0 is an educational software package intended to run on basic personal computers and utilizing modern software technologies such as QuickTime VR 2.0 and VRML 2.0, to provide the students with insight into modern clinical and scientific visualization, focusing on the anatomy and functionality of the human brain. The aim of this paper to test the validity and usefulness of these new visualization techniques.
<p>
METHODS:
3D-Brain is based on human brains sliced in 1 mm sections (NB. NOT based on NLMs Visual Human). Each slice was photographed, digitized, optimized and aligned using proprietary software. The datasets were then created by manual tracing followed by triangulation, smoothing and 3D visualization using Silicon Graphics computers. For the QuickTime VR project, 684 images with a 10 degrees angle were generated for each scene and ported to an Apple Macintosh computer for further manipulation. VRML code was generated directly from the original dataset. All interactivity was programmed on a Macintosh and subsequently ported to the Windows95 PC platform. The minimum requirements to run the software are either a PowerPC based Macintosh computer or a Pentium based Windows 95 computer with 16 Mb, 16 bit display and a 4 speed CD-ROM.
<p>
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
3D-Brain 2.0 provides medical students at Goteborg University the means to complement traditional teaching using visualization techniques and three-dimensional models. These techniques also serve as an insight into the different clinical means of visualization the student will encounter throughout his/her continued education and professional career. For educational purposes, it has been established that among the tested new visualization techniques, CD-ROM based software utilizing QTVR is still the best methodology to use for pedagogical software. VRML shows promise in porting these software packages to the Web while Open Inventor is the preferred format for research purposes.
